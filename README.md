## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to transform, analyse and visualize the sales data of a particular coffee store over a number of years and between 3 countries. This project would allow for actionable insights which would lead to more informed business decisions

## Data Sources
Coffee Orders Data: The primary dataset for this project is the "coffeeOrdersData.xlsx" dataset. This consists of three sheets; customers, orders and products. These three sheets provide detailed information regarding coffee products, pricing, sales, customers and order details.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel - Data Tranformation, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization

## Data Transformation
This stage involves the cleaning and preparation of the dataset for analysis and visualization. The actions performed in this stage are as follows;
- Data Loading and Inspection
- Removal of duplicate values
- Updated the data values in the Roast Type column to allow for more detailed analysis
- Utilized the index, if, match and xlookup functions to populate the empty columns in the Orders sheet
- Created the Sales Revenue column using the Quantity and Unit Price Columns for further analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This stage involves the analysis of the coffee sales data to derive actionable insights and enable informed decision making. This was done with the aid of pivot tables to answer the following questions;
- What is the annual sales revenue for the past 4 years?
- Who are the top 5 customers by revenue generated?
- What is the annual sales revenue by country?
- What coffee type generates the most revenue?
- What roast type generates the most revenue?

## Data Visualization
This involves the use of pivot charts, graphs and slicers to visually represent the coffee orders data in an interactive dashboard 

## Results/Findings
The analyses results and findings can be summarized as follows;
- There has been a stable but trend in coffee sales revenue with 2021 being the most successful year revenue wise
- Alis Wilmore is our top customer
- A bulk of our sales revenue comes from the United States when compared to the United States and Ireland
- Liberica generates the most revenue
- Light roast coffee type generates the most revenue

## Recommendations
The recommendations regarding the coffee sales analysis are summarized below;
- Conduct research to find countries with "coffee culture" and open more stores in the most profitable regions
- Review the operations of stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland to identify opportunities to boost revenues
- Create promos and discounts in order to increase customer patronage and boost the quantities sold
- Collaborate with organisations to provide coupon cards to staff at nearby coffee stores
- Conduct customer surveys to identify preferences and areas of improvement
- Review the current price structures to identify areas to change prices and boost revenue. This is particularly applicable to Robosta as it is the worst performing coffee type revenue wise
